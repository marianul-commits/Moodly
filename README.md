# Moodly
 
Moodly is a personal project aimed at creating a mood tracking app similar to Health - State of Mind

## Features

### Home
The user can quick add a mood from the home widget, see how many moods it tracked in total with a history of them, and have a quick glance at the past 3 days

### Journal
Moodly allows users to quickly jot down their thoughts from throughout the day and assigning emotions to them

### Emotions & Spheres of life
Users are presented with a starting cast of emotions, and spheres of life that they can customize to better express themselves 

### Calendar
The Calendar page allows users to track their mood at the start, middle and end of the day, granting plenty of insight. It is inspired by [Year in Pixels](https://year-in-pixels.com/?v=f5b15f58caba)

### Saving
The app saves its values in two main ways, the Journal entries are saved using the new SwiftData and the Calendar Pixels are saved using a custom plist implementation

## Inspiration

I've been inspired by multiple things, but two of the main sources of inspirations are\
[Paul Hudson's SwifData project](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftdata/swiftdata-tutorial-building-a-complete-project)\
[NelGlez - MoodDiary app](https://github.com/nelglez/MoodDiarySwiftUI/tree/master) - main source of inspiration and using his custom implementation of the plist saving structure
